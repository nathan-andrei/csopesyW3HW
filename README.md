This is the source code for an assignment wherein I must support `screen` commands in a CLI to open consoles for processes.

This can be ran using visual studio code with the C/C++ extension. You must have all these files in the same directory, and open `W3Main.cpp` in vscode, then press run with the compiler and it should work.
Remember to ensure that you have the Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) compiler toolset. You must also open vscode using the MSVC command line by typing `developer command Prompt for VS` in the search menu in windows, and then typing in `code .` to open vscode in the MSVC CLI.
Open this directory/folder in that instance of vscode and you should be able to run it.
